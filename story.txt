The story was that there was actually none, it was made up, or so the rabbit thought.

"No, it exist!!!! And you are the main character" the bear argued to the rabbit.The rabbit felt suprised and said "WHAT?????? You must be kidding me!!!!! How can I be a character in the silly story?"
"Then how do you know it is a silly story? Ah, that is why you are the main character in this silly story." the bear told the rabbit.
"Ah that makes sense" said the rabbit to the bear.
Now I understand how i am the main character of the story.
